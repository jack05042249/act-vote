# Vote Persistence Test - Manual Verification Guide

## Test Objective
Verify that the "Vote" button disables after voting and remains disabled even after a page reload, using localStorage to persist vote state.

## Test Setup
1. Open the voting application in a web browser
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Navigate to Application/Storage tab to monitor localStorage

## Test Procedure

### Step 1: Initial State Verification
**Expected Behavior:**
- All contestant cards should display "Vote" buttons in enabled state
- localStorage should be empty (no 'talent-voting-state' key)
- Voting status should show "1 Vote Remaining"

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Check localStorage in console
localStorage.getItem('talent-voting-state')
// Should return: null
```

### Step 2: Cast a Vote
**Action:**
1. Click the "Vote" button on any contestant card
2. Observe the button behavior during submission
3. Wait for vote confirmation toast

**Expected Behavior:**
- Button shows "Voting..." with loading spinner during submission
- After 1 second, button changes to "Voted" with heart icon and green background
- Button becomes disabled
- Toast notification appears: "Your vote for [Contestant Name] has been recorded"
- Voting status updates to show voted contestant name

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Check localStorage after voting
localStorage.getItem('talent-voting-state')
// Should return something like:
// {"hasVoted":true,"votedFor":"contestant-1","remainingVotes":0}
```

### Step 3: Attempt Additional Votes
**Action:**
1. Try to click vote buttons on other contestant cards

**Expected Behavior:**
- All other vote buttons should be disabled
- Button text should show "Already Voted"
- Buttons should have disabled styling (muted colors)
- Clicking disabled buttons should show toast: "You've already cast your vote for this round"

### Step 4: Page Reload Test (Critical)
**Action:**
1. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Wait for page to fully load
3. Observe all contestant cards

**Expected Behavior:**
- The previously voted contestant should show "Voted" button (green, disabled, with heart icon)
- All other contestants should show "Already Voted" buttons (disabled)
- Voting status should still show the voted contestant name
- localStorage should retain the same voting state

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Verify localStorage persists after reload
localStorage.getItem('talent-voting-state')
// Should return the same JSON as before reload
```

### Step 5: Browser Session Persistence Test
**Action:**
1. Close the browser tab
2. Open a new tab and navigate back to the voting app
3. Observe the state

**Expected Behavior:**
- Vote state should persist exactly as before
- Previously voted contestant should still show "Voted" status
- localStorage data should be intact

### Step 6: Vote Reset Test (Admin Feature)
**Action:**
1. Click the "Reset Votes" button in the header
2. Observe the state changes

**Expected Behavior:**
- All vote buttons should return to "Vote" enabled state
- localStorage should be cleared
- Voting status should reset to "1 Vote Remaining"

**Verification:**
```javascript
// Check localStorage after reset
localStorage.getItem('talent-voting-state')
// Should return: null
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### localStorage Structure
```typescript
interface StoredVotingState {
  hasVoted: boolean;
  votedFor: string | null;
  remainingVotes: number;
}
```

### Key Code Sections

#### Vote Persistence (useVoting.ts)
```typescript
// Save voting state to localStorage
const saveVotingState = useCallback((newState: Partial<VotingState>) => {
  const updatedState = { ...votingState, ...newState };
  setVotingState(updatedState);
  
  localStorage.setItem(VOTING_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({
    hasVoted: updatedState.hasVoted,
    votedFor: updatedState.votedFor,
    remainingVotes: updatedState.remainingVotes,
  }));
}, [votingState]);

// Load voting state from localStorage on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const savedState = localStorage.getItem(VOTING_STORAGE_KEY);
  if (savedState) {
    try {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(savedState);
      setVotingState(prev => ({ ...prev, ...parsed }));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to parse voting state from localStorage:', error);
    }
  }
}, []);
```

#### Button State Logic (ContestantCard.tsx)
```typescript
const canVote = !hasVoted && isVotingActive;

<Button
  onClick={() => onVote(contestant.id)}
  disabled={!canVote || isLoading}
  className={cn(
    hasVotedFor 
      ? "bg-success hover:bg-success/90 text-success-foreground" 
      : canVote 
        ? "bg-gradient-vote hover:opacity-90 hover:scale-105" 
        : "bg-entertainment-vote-disabled text-muted-foreground cursor-not-allowed"
  )}
>
  {hasVotedFor ? "Voted" : canVote ? "Vote" : "Already Voted"}
</Button>
```

## Automated Test Simulation

For automated testing, the following JavaScript can be run in the browser console:

```javascript
// Automated test function
async function testVotePersistence() {
  console.log('üß™ Testing Vote Persistence...');
  
  // Step 1: Check initial state
  const initialState = localStorage.getItem('talent-voting-state');
  console.log('Initial localStorage:', initialState);
  
  // Step 2: Simulate vote (find first vote button and click)
  const voteButton = document.querySelector('button:not([disabled])');
  if (voteButton && voteButton.textContent === 'Vote') {
    console.log('üó≥Ô∏è Clicking vote button...');
    voteButton.click();
    
    // Wait for vote to process
    setTimeout(() => {
      const afterVoteState = localStorage.getItem('talent-voting-state');
      console.log('After vote localStorage:', afterVoteState);
      
      // Step 3: Reload page and check persistence
      console.log('üîÑ Reloading page...');
      setTimeout(() => {
        window.location.reload();
      }, 2000);
    }, 1500);
  } else {
    console.log('‚ùå No vote button found or already voted');
  }
}

// Run the test
testVotePersistence();
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Test Passes If:**
- Vote button disables immediately after clicking
- Button state persists through page reload
- localStorage contains correct voting data
- UI accurately reflects voting state
- Error handling works for duplicate vote attempts

‚ùå **Test Fails If:**
- Button re-enables after page reload
- localStorage is cleared unexpectedly
- Vote state is lost between sessions
- Multiple votes can be cast
- UI state doesn't match localStorage data

## Browser Compatibility
This test should pass in all modern browsers:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Notes
- localStorage has a storage limit (~5-10MB per domain)
- Private/incognito mode may have different localStorage behavior
- Some browsers may clear localStorage after extended periods
- The test demonstrates client-side persistence only (no server validation)
